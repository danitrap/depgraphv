This is the list of features I would like to add in dep-graphV.
I don't have any kind of time-table of when I plan to implement these
features, and there's no particular order.

* A "manual-mode" to manually arrange some graph vertices by dragging them;
* Copy-paste support (???);
* Select graph background;
* Select font family used by vertices labels;
* Optionally subdivide an huge graph into multiple small portions, maybe accessible by multiple tab pages;
* Per-folder and/or per-src subgraphs;
* Highlight vertex and its connected edges;
* Detect graph cycles and warn about them (Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm wich is O(E+V) in the worst case);
* Run as stand-alone or as Qt Creator plugin (or any other "compatible" IDE);
* Watch over file system changes and automatically update the graph;
* Optionally add redundand include guards;
* Navigate to source code function, that allow users to easily see/edit the code by double-clicking a vertex in the graph.
* Generate either "include" or "included-by" graphs.
