This is the list of features I would like to add in dep-graphV.
I don't have any kind of time-table of when I plan to implement these
features, and there's no particular order.

* Multiple graph layout algorithms;
* A "manual-mode" to manually arrange some graph vertices by dragging them;
* Copy-paste support (???);
* Selecting background and graph theme;
* Optionally subdividing an huge graph into multiple small portions, maybe accessible by multiple tab pages;
* Selecting font family used by vertices labels;
* Per-folder and/or per-src subgraphs;
* Highlightning of vertex and of its connected edges;
* Multi-threaded folders scan;
* Detecting graph cycles and warn about them (Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm wich is O(E+V) in the worst case);
* Running as stand-alone or as Qt Creator plugin (or any other "compatible" IDE);
* Watch over file system changes and automatically update the graph;
* Folders exclude list; It should be possible to specify a list of folders ignored when recursively scanning a source folder.
  This feature should allow users to add, enable(default state after adding a folder), disable or remove a folder from this list.
* Optionally add redundand include guards;
* Navigate to source code function, that allow users to easily see/edit the code by double-clicking a vertex in the graph.
* Generate either "include" or "included-by" graphs.
