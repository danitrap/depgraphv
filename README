This is the distribution of dep-graphV, which is an useful development tool,
written in C++ and powered by Qt and GraphViz, that creates a graph of your codebase,
by parsing every #include statement found in the project's root folder.
It is helpful when you need to analize and visualize the dependecy tree,
highlightining cycles and "useless paths", and It means, in short, that you could drastically
reduce build times, especially when working on large-scale projects.

Main Features:
* CMake based build, so it's easy to switch between different platforms/IDEs;
* Build against Qt4 or Qt5 by simply changing QT_USE_QT5 variable value in CMake;
* OpenGL rendering support;
* Optional recursive folder scan;
* Customizable file extension filters (for both header and source files);
* Graphs can be saved as images (.bmp, .eps, .gd, .gd2, .gif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .ps, .svg or any other format made available by GraphViz plugins) or in GraphViz dot format;
* Localized user interface (currently only english and italian are available);
* Persistent user settings;

The sources distribution contains the following folders and files:

	cmake/	- CMake scripts
	i18n/	- Translation files
	res/	- Resources
	src/	- Header and source files
	ui/	- Forms and dialogs in Qt Designer UI format

	AUTHORS
	ChangeLog
	CMakeLists.txt
	COPYING
	README - this file.
